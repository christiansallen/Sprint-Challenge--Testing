1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
   describe() is used to group a set of tests together, whereas it() is an actual test. It's good to use describe() so it's more organized.

2) What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
   Test Driven Development is used as a process to find the minimum amount of code in order to pass a test. I think it's a good process for larger projects, not necessarily needed for small projects.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.
   UI Regression Test, Unit Test, and Integration Test
